Specific Gmail filters for maintaining daily focus

## Overview

As a product manager, I have to accept and process many inputs, so I need my tools to work with me â€” not against me.  Gmail is one of the latter.

Email is a born noise machine.  And despite being around for so many years, Gmail doesn't really help out much.  So I've designed these filters that you can import to acheive the following:

1. Mark unimportant stuff as read (so you're not distracted by badge counts)
2. Move stuff out of your inbox into label-specific folders (so what's left in your inbox is truly-actionable)

When complete, basically all that's left in your inbox will be:

1. "Real" email from "real" people
2. Meeting invites
3. Specific mentions within systems like Jira, Confluence, etc.

## Usage

To import these filters into your own Gmail:

1. Download mailFilters.xml to your local computer
2. Log into [Gmail](http://mail.google.com)
3. On the top-right, click the settings (gear) icon, then click All Settings
4. Navigate to the Filters and Blocked Addresses tab
5. Scroll to the bottom
6. Click the Import Filters link
7. Click the Choose File button
8. In the Finder dialog, select the mailFilters.xml file
